# phyllaplysia-thermalphys
Code and formatted data files for analyses of Phyllaplysia taylori thermal tolerance traits

Permanent data DOIs for the full dataset: Physiological data are available at https://doi.pangaea.de/10.1594/PANGAEA.924368 and https://doi.pangaea.de/10.1594/PANGAEA.925174; genetic data are available at NCBI PRJNA590727.

Five R files are contained within this repository that produce the statistical analyses, tables, and graphs in the main article and supplemental files. Three of these files are related to the genetic data, including selection of best processing settings. The main file that produced most of the physiological statistical analyses, tables, and graphs is in CTmax-resprates, but other analyses that reference abiotic data are contained within abiotic-ARR. 

This repository is organized by folder containing a single R file and the required data files to run the code.
